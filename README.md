# How to use:
Simply download and run the .jar file. Click the button to select a .ric file, and press Convert to convert to .png. *The .png file will be saved in the same folder/location as the .ric file you just converted.*

I hope you enjoy using this useful tool!

# Troubleshooting
File does not run.
-  Make sure you have the latest version of Java installed.

Conversion does not work.
- RICtoPNG will only convert Mindstorms NXT .ric Image Files. Other file types will not be converted.
