# How to download:
Press the green "Code" button, click "Download ZIP", then extract the ZIP once it has downloaded.

# How to use:
Simply run the .jar file that was extracted from the ZIP. You may get a warning about an unsafe file; simply click "Continue", "Run Anyway", etc.

When the app is open, click the "Convert .RIC file..." button to select a .ric file, and press "Convert" to convert it to a .png image. If you hold down Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac) while clicking, you can select multiple files. *The .png image will be saved in the same folder/location as the .ric file you just converted.*

I hope you enjoy using this useful tool!

# Troubleshooting:
The .jar file does not run.
-  Make sure you have the latest version of Java installed.

The conversion did not work.
- RICtoPNG will only convert Mindstorms NXT .ric Image Files. Other file types will not be converted.

The converted image is blurry.
- Images are converted at their original low resolution and some photo apps will blur them on purpose. Open the .png in an image-editing tool like Microsoft Paint to see the image without blur. Or, use an image upscaling tool online to increase the resolution.
